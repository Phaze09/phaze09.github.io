<h1>Questions</h1>
<h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
<p>A CSS media query works by using the @media rule to apply styles only when certain conditions about a user’s device or viewport are met, such as its width, height, or orientation. When the browser detects that the condition inside the media query is true, it applies the CSS rules within that block. If the condition is false, those styles are ignored. This makes media queries super useful for responsive web design because they allow a website’s layout, typography, and overall design to adapt to different screen sizes and user preferences. Making sure everyone has a great experience across phones, tablets, laptops and desktops.</p>
<h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" — and what do they do? Pick any 4 to explain.</h2>
<p>Media queries support many different media features that test specific characteristics of a device or user setting. For example, max-width applies styles when the viewport is at or below a certain width, making it useful for mobile layouts, while min-width applies styles when the viewport reaches a minimum size, often used to enhance layouts for larger screens. The orientation feature detects whether a device is in portrait or landscape mode and allows layouts to adjust when a device is rotated. Another important feature is prefers-reduced-motion, which checks whether a user has enabled a system setting to reduce animations, allowing developers to limit motion effects for accessibility and comfort.</p>
