<h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Absolute vs Relative</h2>

<p><b>Absolute Length Units</b> are fixed and don't change based on the screen size, parent elements, or user settings. They represent a specific physical or fixed size.</p>

<p><b>Relative Length Unites</b> change dependinng on something else like the parent element, the root element, or the viewport size.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Describing Units</h2>
<h3>px, pt</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Lists</li>
	<li>Tables</li>
	<li>Paragraphs</li>
	<li>Horizontal rules like hr</li>
	<li>Headlines like h1, h2, etc.</li>
	<li>Any other HTML tags</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also add as much CSS as you want. Or as little. It's up to you.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to simulate the appearance of a tag, use the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters to show < and >.</p>
