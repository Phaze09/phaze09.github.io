		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Make the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.</li>
			<li>Make the chicken: Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
			<li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once it’s shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)</li>
			<li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
			<li>Make the Alfredo sauce: In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted.</li>
			<li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</li>
			<li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.</li>
			<li>Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)</li>
			<li>Assemble: Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li>
			<li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
